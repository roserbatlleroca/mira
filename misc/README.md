Folder where the weights of the models will be downloaded when following the environment instructions. 
Feel free to delete this folder if you would like to store the weights elsewhere. Note that then you MUST change the specification of the directories at `model_path` in [clap.py](../mira_eval/clap.py) and [defnet.py](../mira_eval/defnet.py).
